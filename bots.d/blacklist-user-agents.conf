# Add One Entry Per Line - List all the extra bad User-Agents you want to permanently block or whitelist.

# This is for User-Agents that are not included in the main list of the bot blocker
# This file must exist on your system or Nginx will fail a reload due to a missing file
# This allows you finer control of keeping certain bots blocked and automatic updates will
# Never be able to remove this custom list of yours 

# Please note this include file loads first before any of the already whitelisted User-Agents
# in the bad bot blocker. By loading first in line it over-rides anything below it so for instance
# if you want to block Baidu, Google or Bing for any reason you add them to this file which loads
# first and takes precedence over anything below it. This now allows even finer control over the 
# bad bot blocker. Enjoy !!!

# Even though this file is called blacklist-user-agents, as mentioned it can also be used to whitelist user agents
# By adding them below and setting the 3; to 0; this will permanently whitelist the User-Agent.

# Make sure any words that contain special characters are escaped and include word boundaries as per the Regex examples below.

# Example the User-Agent name "someverybaduseragentname1" is entered as "(?:\b)someverybaduseragentname1(?:\b)"
# Example the User-Agent name "some-very-bad-useragentname2" is entered as "(?:\b)some\-very\-bad\-useragentname1(?:\b)" 
# the "(?:\b)" and "(?:\b)" are word boundaries which prevents partial matching and false positives.

# BY DEFAULT ALL THE EXAMPLES BELOW ARE COMMENTED OUT AND HENCE NOT ENABLED

# ---------------------

# Here are some default things I block on my own server, these appear in various types of injection attacks
# You can disable them if you have problems or don't agree by switching thir value to 0 or moving them into the whitelist section first and then making their value 0
